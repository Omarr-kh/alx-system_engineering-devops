Users reported slow response times and intermittent errors during the incident.
Timeline:

Detection:

Time: January 15, 2024, 10:15 AM (UTC)
The issue was initially detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates and latency.
Actions Taken:

Engineers were alerted and immediately initiated an investigation into the affected system components.
Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to recent code deployments or an underlying infrastructure problem.
Initial investigation focused on the application servers and database clusters.
Misleading Paths:

Initial suspicion fell on recent code changes, leading to an extensive code rollback. However, this did not resolve the issue.
Network configurations were explored, causing a temporary shift in focus from application-level components.
Escalation:

As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the senior engineering team and the infrastructure team.
Collaborative efforts were made to isolate the root cause.
Resolution:

The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic and overloading certain application servers.
Load balancing algorithms were adjusted, and the misconfigured settings were corrected.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an uneven distribution of traffic among application servers. Some servers were overloaded, resulting in degraded performance.
Resolution:

Load balancer configurations were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among available application servers.
Additional monitoring was implemented to detect and alert on load balancer misconfigurations promptly.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Regular load balancer configuration reviews to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide more granular insights into load balancer performance and configurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations across all environments.
Implement automated tests to verify load balancer settings align with application server capacities.
Enhance monitoring alerts for load balancer performance and configuration changes.
Document and communicate best practices for load balancer configuration among the engineering team.
This incident highlighted the criticality of robust monitoring systems and the importance of considering load balancing configurations in maintaining system reliability. Moving forward, we are committed to implementing the outlined corrective and preventative measures to ensure the seamless functioning of our web stack.

Conclusion:
The outage served as a valuable learning experience, emphasizing the need for vigilance in monitoring and meticulous configuration management. By addressing the identified issues and implementing the outlined measures, we aim to fortify our web stack against similar incidents in the future, providing a more resilient experience for our users.
