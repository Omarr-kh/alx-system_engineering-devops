Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident - A Tale of Load Balancers Gone Wild

Issue Summary:
So, picture this â€“ it's a regular day in the web universe, and suddenly our primary web application decides to take a siesta. From 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM (UTC), our web stack experienced a dramatic plot twist, leaving users with a 30% degraded user experience. Slow response times and intermittent errors took center stage, making it a day to remember for all the wrong reasons.

Timeline:

Detection:
January 15, 2024, 10:15 AM (UTC) â€“ Our automated monitoring alarms went off like a car alarm at 3 AM. Error rates spiked, latency joined the party uninvited, and chaos ensued. Engineers woke up from their code-induced dreams to face the harsh reality.

Actions Taken:
Engineers leaped into action like caffeinated squirrels. Suspecting a code deployment disaster or a rebellious infrastructure, they embarked on a mission to unravel the mystery.

Misleading Paths:
The initial suspect â€“ recent code changes. Cue the dramatic code rollback. But alas, the villain remained elusive. Next, network configurations were dragged into the interrogation room, causing a temporary shift in focus. Code and networks, the ultimate red herrings.

Escalation:
As the plot thickened, our distress signal reached the senior engineering team and the infrastructure superheroes. A team effort to unravel the enigma ensued.

Resolution:
Cue the drumroll â€“ the culprit was unmasked! A misconfigured load balancer was playing favorites, causing a traffic frenzy that left some servers overworked and others twiddling their digital thumbs. Load balancing algorithms were readjusted, and settings were scolded back into order.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
A load balancer with commitment issues led to an uneven distribution of traffic, turning our server farm into a digital Hunger Games arena.

Resolution:
Balancing act perfected â€“ configurations adjusted, monitoring beefed up, and load balancers put on a tight leash.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Regular load balancer therapy sessions (config reviews).
Enhanced monitoring systems â€“ our load balancer whisperers.
Automated tests to ensure load balancer settings play nice with server capacities.
Best practices documented and circulated â€“ load balancers, meet etiquette.

Conclusion:
In the grand saga of our web stack, this outage was the unexpected plot twist. Lesson learned: vigilance, monitoring, and load balancer manners are non-negotiable. As we march boldly into the future, armed with corrected configurations and newfound wisdom, our web stack vows to stand tall against the chaos of misconfigurations, ensuring a seamless and drama-free experience for our users. Until the next episode, stay balanced, folks! ðŸš€
